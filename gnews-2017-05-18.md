## SAS Mocked For Being Too Specific?
- Recommending 60% Proprietary Software, 40% Open Source
- open source technology "has its own, often unexpected costs,"
- SAS correctly argues that open source versus proprietary software is not an either/or decision
- put the percentage of open source adopters at a mere 25%, which is pathetically wrong
- Adobe's vice president of mobile commented on Twitter, "I just wonder who in their marketing dept thought this was a good idea
- "for example, more than half don’t take into account the need to replace expertise if employees leave"
